      <h1>Get your dose of street art/grafitti here!</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my blog where I will be repping THE very best in grafitti and
        street art around the world. I appreciate that art is subjective, but
        trust me, I've got an eye for quality. I view street art and grafitti in
        particular as bedfellows with my other passion that is music, and more
        specifically drum and bass. They both come from the street and has deep
        roots culturally with what is sometimes known as the 'concrete jungle'.
        Being born in London and living in areas where life wasn't always easy,
        the urban chaos became a backdrop for youth to express themselves
        artistically. The music of drum and bass also came from these very same
        communities - forgotten communities in some ways. This artistic
        crossover is raw and I have carefully selected pieces that represent
        this culture that continues to have influence on our lives in so many
        ways - sometimes without even knowing it!
