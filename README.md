REFLECTIONS:

PROJECT OUTLINE: As you can see from the wireframe and database schema I have set out to create a simple blog site. Based on my previous issues even getting an app to work, it was best to keep it simple. My personal objectives for this particular project were simply to get the bare bones of a blog site available to see for the user and then work from there.

PERSONAL ACHEIVEMENTS:

1. Based on previous experience of weekly projects I identified how important it was in getting the server talking to the database and retreiving data to be rendered on the blog site. I managed to do this and was very intentional with my time on Friday so that I could ask for some assistance from Manny and Joe. It honestly felt like I had walked up Mount Everest in simply getting the list of blogs onto a static page. During that process I connected a few more dots about the naming conventions, and the sequence of code to allow that to happen. So that was a happy moment.

2. Following on from the momentum of that mini victory, I then attempted to tackle the dynamic pages for each of the street artists from my databse. This proved a very time consuming exercise as I had to go through many workshop videos and look at the code of each workshop and try to make sense of it. The errors I had to work through were a mixture of 'undefined handling error'; 'params not defined' and also an issue with image loading from external source... "Error invalid src prop on next image hostname is not configured under images in next config" - thankfully I found the solution to this via a very handy youtube video which provided to a code fix for my nextjs config file - where you can dictate which protocols you want to allow, plus domains. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVta5wB3ByU
   Once that was fixed I could see my content.

3. I also managed after much fiddling about to get the comments working and rendering onto the site and also saving in the database. Although that said, i noticed it wasn't saving the date.

OTHER REFLECTIONS:

As has always been the case I simply run out of time to finish the project. I find it a massive effort to keep on task and within time boundaries which I am acutely aware of. I'm not going to be too hard on myself as there has been some progress in other areas. The CSS and styling always come last as I am mostly trying to deal with other functionality issues that affect what I can actually see on the screen. I feel a little bit more confident about Next.js, but the fact of the matter is I am quite slow. Once again I am not going to be too hard on myself about this as I think with some more time to spend practicing on certain areas I would hope to speed up.

My wire frame and database scheme image files are included in the public file that I've created in the project.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
